# Introduction

This is a simple playground toy for benchmark some operations on GPU buffer.
Which I interested in:
* the cost of mapping and unmapping buffer
* the cost of copy buffer
* the cost of CPU based flood fill

# Usage

```bash
cargo bench
```

See result in `target/criterion/report/index.html`.
